# Challenges

## About the challenges
To shake my brain before starting a learning session, I work on a problem from [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) which would be a good source of plenty of problems ranging from easy to hard.
## Solutions
They are my own solutions. So far, I am most familiar with JavaScript so it would be the main language I use in this repository.
## Problem-solving process
Facing a problem, this is my typical problem-solving process:
1. Analyse the problem to unstanding the input and expected output.

2. Break down the problem if needed.

3. Solve it using pseudo code. For easy problems, I am a bit lazy that I do not write down pseudo code. However, for more difficult and complicate ones, writing them down is super useful, especially for debugging with logical errors. You will find my notes (or comments) of pseudo code in each solution file.

4. Write the solution using the programming language

    Note: I often handle edge cases first.

5. Usually, the process would include a loop of multiple times of step 1, 2, 3, and 5, especially in solving hard problems. 
## For future
The current solutions may not optimal. I may revise them in the future because the final goal is not just solving but solving in the best way.
